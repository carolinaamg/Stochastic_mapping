# Stochastic_mapping
This code allows to identify  enriched **Orthologous Groups (OG)** in the internal nodes of a rooted phylogenetic tree.

*enriched_OG* will use a rooted-ultrametric phylogenetic tree in newick format **(see example file)** as well as presence/absence matrix **(see example file)** as input files. *enriched_OG* will create a stochastic mapping distribution **(N to be decided by the user)** and a simulated distribution. These distributions can be statistically compared to find OG enriched in specific nodes of the input phylogenetic tree. In addition, *enriched_OG* will generate a matrix with the enriched OG for each node of the input tree.
